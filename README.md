# Filter-Design-using-Teaching-Learning-Based-Algoritghm
In this project, optimal FIR filters are designed using teaching learning based optimization technique which is a population-based optimization algorithm based on the  effect of the influence of a teacher on the output of learners in a class. It is an algorithm- specific parameter-less algorithm. It uses the teaching learning phenomenon of a classroom to  solve multi-dimensional, linear and nonlinear problems with very high efficiency. The designing method is demonstrated for the design of low pass (LP), high pass (HP), band pass (BP) and band stop (BS) FIR filters. The simulation is performed in MATLABÂ®  to get the  filter coefficients and magnitude response.
